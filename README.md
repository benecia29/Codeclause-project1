Snowphoria is a weather website made using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS. I developed this on Visual Studio Code. This project was made mainly to implement API calling using FetchAPI. This website displays weather information from various places all over the world using a weather API. 
Please run the WeatherApp.html file which acts as the index.html.
